# Employee Performance Analysis Using the DIKW Framework

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to apply the **DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom)** framework to understand, analyze, and derive insights from an employee performance dataset.

## Dataset
Use the **"DIKW_HW_Activity Dataset"**, which contains data on employee performance. The dataset is provided as an attachment to this assignment. You may either download it or manually create a CSV file with the data.

## Instructions

### 1. Data
   - **Task**: Examine the raw data in the CSV file. Open it using spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) or load it in Python (e.g., using Pandas DataFrame).
   - **Objective**: Understand data fields such as `EmployeeID`, `EmployeeName`, `Department`, `Salary`, `PerformanceScore`, etc.
   - **Questions to Answer**:
     - What are the different types of data present (e.g., categorical, numerical)?
     - What are some examples of raw data from the dataset?

### 2. Information
   - **Task**: Process the data to create meaningful summaries. You may use spreadsheet formulas or Python code.
   - **Tasks to Complete**:
     - Calculate the average salary for each department.
     - Find the number of employees in each country.
     - Determine the average performance score for all employees.
   - **Example Findings**:
     - "The average salary in the Engineering department is $73,500."
     - "The number of employees in the USA is 2."

### 3. Knowledge
   - **Objective**: Answer the following questions:
     - Which department has the highest average performance score? Why might this be the case?
     - Which countries have the most satisfied employees based on the job satisfaction score?

### 4. Applying Wisdom for Decision-Making
   - **Objective**: Imagine you are an HR manager seeking to improve employee satisfaction and performance. Answer the following:
     - How can you improve job satisfaction for the department with the lowest scores?
     - What kind of training or incentives would you suggest for improving employee performance?
     - Are there any notable differences in salaries by gender that should be addressed?

## Submission and Grading
Submit a report that includes responses to all tasks mentioned in the four sections. You may submit this as a **Word document, PDF, or Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)**.

### Grading Criteria
1. Complete understanding of the dataset.
2. Accurate calculations and meaningful summaries.
3. Appropriate interpretation of information.
4. Thoughtful recommendations for improvement.
5. Clarity, completeness, and professionalism of the report.

### Bonus Task
- Visualize your findings and submit the assignment in a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`).
